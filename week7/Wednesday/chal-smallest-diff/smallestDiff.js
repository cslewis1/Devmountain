This is a short-length challenge, but requires some clever thinking.
Given two lists, find the smallest difference (subtraction) between any two nums.

For example, given the arrays:

[10, 20, 14, 16, 18]
[30, 23, 54, 33, 96]
The result would be 3, since 23 - 20 = 3 is the smallest difference 
of any pair of numbers in those lists.

Write a function that determines the smallest difference. */

const smallestDiff = (arr1, arr2) => {
    arr1.forEach(el1 => { 
        arr2.forEach(el2 => el - el2 )
        
    });
}
